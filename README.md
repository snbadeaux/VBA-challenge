Module 2 VBA Excel Stock Analysis Challenge

This Reposition includes a text file of the code itself as well as a VBA script file because the .xlsm was too big to upload to GitHub
It also includes three screenshots of the product of the VBA code to show the answers that correspond to each year of the stock information.

I got help from these sources:
